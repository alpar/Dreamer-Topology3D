Dreamer-Topology3D
==================

Topology 3D (Designer Deployer & Director)
a result of Dreamer Project (GÃ‰ANT Open Call).

Overview
-----------
Topology 3D includes is a simple and intuitive JavaScript Web GUI  ([demo](http://stud.netgroup.uniroma2.it/OSHI/TopoDesigner)), which allows to design an network topology and to configure the services. It can support different "models" (i.e. technology domains) in an exendible way: currently it supports a network of standard OpenFlow device and a network made by OSHI (Open Source Hybrid IP/SDN) nodes. It can export the topologies in JSON format and then they can be deployed. It is also possible to synthetically generate a topology using Networkx. Topology-Designer is a customization of [JS GRAPH EDITOR](https://github.com/rkirov/graph-editor.js) written by Radoslav Kirov.

---------------------------

## Requires
- WebServer (apache2, nginx, etc..) (optional)
- Dreamer-Topology-and-Service-Validator [(can be found here)](https://github.com/netgroup/Dreamer-Topology-and-Service-Validator) 
- Dreamer-Experiment-Handler [(can be found here)](https://github.com/netgroup/Dreamer-Experiment-Handler.git) (optional)

 --------------------
Getting Started
---------------------

Assuming git installed:

```sh
$ git clone https://github.com/netgroup/Dreamer-Topology3D.git
```
**Set the address and the port of the server that runs the Dreamer-Topology-and-Service-Validator and the Dreamer-Experiment-Handler project.** By default Dreamer-Topology-and-Service-Validator endpoints are local (0.0.0.0:8001), otherwise modify the file **js/src/config.js** according to your deployment. 
By default:

		//Dreamer-Topology-and-Service-Validator
		this.top_ser_validator = {};
		this.top_ser_validator.host_port = 8080;
		this.top_ser_validator.host_name = "127.0.0.1";

		//Experiment Handler
		this.experiment_handler = {};
		this.experiment_handler.host_port = 3000;
		this.experiment_handler.host_name = "127.0.0.1";
